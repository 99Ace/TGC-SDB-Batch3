        <p><b>SINGAPORE:</b> The current <i>COVID-19</i> measures will only be tightened as a "last resort" when
            Singapore's healthcare system is under heavy strain, said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung in Parliament on
            Monday (Jan 10).</p>
        <p>"It is the (multi-ministry task force’s) hope that we can ride through the Omicron wave with the current safe
            management measures," he said in response to questions on whether stricter rules will be put in place.</p>
        <p>
            The task force had earlier said that the existing rules, such as limiting group sizes to five people, 
            <a class="article-link" href="">remain during the Chinese New Year period.</a></p>

        <h3>LARGER OMICRON WAVE EXPECTED</h3>
        <p>Singapore can expect an infection wave “several times larger” than the one caused by Delta, said Mr Ong,
            citing the Omicron variant's higher transmissibility.</p>
